Overview 
This test demonstrates a simple web-based dinner reservation form that collects a user's name, phone number, preferred dinner time, and meal preferences. The form uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to validate user input and display a reservation summary. Javascript checks for required fields, validates formats, and displays clear feedback messages.

Contributions 
While the core HTML structure was pre-provided, I corrected the radio button group logic by giving all time selection inputs the same name so that only one option can be selected at a time. Similarly, I implemented logic for name and phone number validation, as well as displaying the reservation message. Also, I disabled the Sumbmit button by default and only enable it when both fields are valid. Lastly, I used AI to help me organize the JavaScript code, apply condition checks, and handle real-time validation feedback.
